### General

When you use the skills you have to talk to Alexa. This voice input is
sent to Amazon and us where we use it to understand what the skill should
do for you. This is absolutely necessary for the service to give you an
appropriate answer.

### Data

We never collect or share personal data with the skills.

To improve our services we analyze automatically how often utterances are
spoken and other analytics. This is done automatically by Amazon in the
Amazon Developer Portal.

For some of the skills it is necessary to save data for you in our
databases. This data is never connected to your name or any other personal
information. Otherwise, this service could not be provided to you.

### Changes

The skills or parts of it may change or be updated at any time. Further,
this Privacy Policy might change. You can find a link to this policy on
the description page of the skill in the Alexa App or in the Alexa Store.
Your continued use of the skill after changes of the Privacy Policy or the
skill itself will be seen as your acceptance of both.
